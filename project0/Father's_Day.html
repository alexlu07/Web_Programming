      <p id ="section1">Today is June 16, 2019, which is also known as Father's Day. Today, you can sit back, relax, and have fun(If you don't get too caught up by the Visas)! And that's why, I created a website from HTML and CSS
      for you. Although this website still doesn't contain any javascript, nor is it an actual published website, we can still see it like an actual website.   </p>
